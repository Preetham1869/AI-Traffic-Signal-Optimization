# AI Traffic Signal Optimization

A Java-based console application that simulates a real-time AI traffic signal system. It dynamically calculates traffic intensity and assigns green signals to the most congested lanes.

## Features
- Accepts real-time input for 4 lanes (vehicle count and average speed).
- Calculates traffic intensity using the formula:  
  `intensity = vehicleCount × (1 / averageSpeed)`
- Assigns green signal to the lane with the highest traffic load.

##  Technologies Used
- Java
- Core OOP principles
- Data Structures (ArrayList)
- CLI (Scanner)
